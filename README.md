# SpotifyClone
In this project, I undertook the challenge of creating a Spotify clone website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to replicate the key features and user experience of the popular music streaming service, Spotify.
Implemented audio playback functionalities using HTML5 audio elements and JavaScript.
I hope it helps you to learn the codes and the logic behind the projects.
